## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

to install the dependencies.

### `npm start`

to run the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
